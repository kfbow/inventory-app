## Weebly Project

1. The easiest way to get the project running is to run `yarn` and then `yarn start`.

2. To build for production, simply run `yarn build` after running `yarn` and a build folder should appear in your directory.

2.5. Run `yarn gogo` and yarn will build all dependencies and create a build folder. No other commands needed!

3. To run tests simply run `yarn test`
